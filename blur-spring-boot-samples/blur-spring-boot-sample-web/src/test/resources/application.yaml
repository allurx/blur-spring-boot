blur:
  # io.allurx.blur.spring.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootMainApplicationClassRunListener
  # Specifies the main application class for the Spring Boot application.
  # This prevents the test class from being treated as the main application class,
  # which would cause AOP interceptors to target the package io.allurx.blur.spring.boot.sample.web.test.
  # Therefore, the actual package of the main application class must be specified here.
